# Nucleus Project: Home Exchange Manager

Nucleus is a web application that allow individuals to exchange their homes - apartment, house, loft, etc - for a short vacation - a day to a few weeks. These exchanges are free, but the counterpart is that each owner defines some services that guests must provide some constraints/limits that they respect.
